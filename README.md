This project was done for "Data compression" lecture
at Institute of Computer Science in WrocÅ‚aw, http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/ .

This repository contains the full sources (for FPC
(Free Pascal Compiler), you will also need Castle Game Engine
units http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php ).
And it contains REPORT.pdf (describing usage and some details).

Compilation:
* Make sure to define $CASTLE_ENGINE_PATH to point to castle_game_engine/
  directory. Get if from http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php .
* Compile by simple "make".
